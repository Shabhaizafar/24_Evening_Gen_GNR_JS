📝 JavaScript Event Propagation Task
Objective:
Understand and demonstrate the differences between event bubbling, event capturing, event delegation, and the use of stopPropagation().

📌 Task Instructions:
Setup HTML:
Create the following HTML structure:

html
Copy
Edit
<div id="parent" style="padding: 30px; background-color: lightblue;">
  Parent
  <button id="child" style="margin: 20px;">Click Me</button>
</div>
JavaScript Tasks:

a. Event Bubbling (Default Behavior)
Attach click event listeners to both the parent and child. Log which element is clicked.
Expected Output: Clicking the child logs both child and parent (bubbling).

b. Event Capturing
Modify the listeners to use the capture phase. Log events.
Hint: Use the third parameter true in addEventListener.
Expected Output: Parent logs first, then child (capturing order).

c. stopPropagation
Add e.stopPropagation() in the child click handler.
Expected Output: Only the child handler should run (bubbling/capturing is stopped).

d. Event Delegation
Remove the child’s individual handler. Instead, listen on the parent and check e.target.
Expected Output: Clicking the child should still trigger a specific response using delegation logic.

✅ Submission Requirements:
A single HTML + JS file.

Clear logs showing the different behaviors.

Short comments in code explaining each step.
